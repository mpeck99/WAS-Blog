Transcripts are similar to but they extend beyond the spoken words. Transcripts include any important sound effects or other visual descriptions to those who: 
- Are hard of hearing
- Are deaf
- Are deafblind

For those who are deafblind transcripts are the only way for deafblind users to access this type of content. 

Transcripts should: 
- Identify who is speaking
- Identify sounds such as applause and laughter
- Describe any visual information

## How to present transcripts
Transcripts are usually presented on the webpage of the media content below or above the video. Or they can be viewed on separate page or dialog box with a link to that location near the video. 

## When are transcripts needed
While they are ***only required*** for pre-recorded audio-only it can be beneficial for accessibility if you provide transcripts for both audio-only and video-only content. 

### Prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) should have a text transcript
This is important for deafblind users who can easily access the information via a refreshable braille device

### Prerecorded audio-only must be accompanied by an easily reachable transcript
This transcript should provide any dialog, narration, or significant sounds/descriptions that occur in the audio. You must also ensure that this transcript is easy to access by placing it near (under) or very close to the audio. If you make it hard to find/access then it really is not beneficial at all. 

### Prerecorded video-only must include audio descriptions or a text transcript
These should include all the text, graphics, facial expressions, actions and any other significant information that is visual. Transcripts are important because they are the only way deafblind users can access your content, so this makes it the better alternative. Audio descriptions can help provide this information to any users who are blind but can hear perfectly well but does not benefit those who are deafblind. 

### Text transcript describing the visual aspects of the video should be provided for video-only content
This transcript should basically function as a long descriptions of the video-only content. This transcript also should appear near (above or below) the video-only content, and be easy to find/access. 

## Methods of presenting transcripts
- Place directly on the page with the audio / video player
  - This allows easy access
  - Also helps SEO since search results will lead users directly to your page
- Provide a link to the transcript
  - Helps not clutter the page and gives the users an option to see the transcript if needed
  - Put the link either next to or directly below the video / audio player for your users to access
- Provide interactive transcript which allows users to access specific places within the video / audio content

### Interactive transcripts
Interactive transcripts allow users to search videos and navigate anywhere in that video by selecting a sentence or word that is in that transcript. This is great for SEO because it allows search engines to crawl through the transcripts text.
