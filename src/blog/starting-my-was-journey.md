Hello all! My name is Morgan Peck and welcome to my blog detailing my journey in earning my [Web Accessibility Specialist certification through IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification). 

The purpose of this blog is to showcase what I am learning through [IAAP's WAS Book of Knowledge](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/WAS_Certification_FInal_2020_FINAL) as well as taking [Deque's WAS Exam Preparation Course](https://dequeuniversity.com/curriculum/packages/iaap-was). 

My first step is to create this blog to host all my the knowledge I am learning as well as share any notes/documentation I am creating along the way.
