# CommonLook Training: Reading Order and Tags for Document Accessibility

In the realm of document accessibility, understanding the intricacies of reading order and tags is key to creating inclusive content. CommonLook, a leading tool in this domain, offers comprehensive training on these vital aspects. Let's dive into the core concepts and best practices outlined in CommonLook's training program.

## Rules to Remediate By

The foundation of CommonLook's approach lies in adhering to specific rules during document remediation. These rules include refraining from adding or removing content from the physical view and maintaining the original document structure without alterations.

## Reading Order and Viewing Tags

A crucial aspect of document accessibility is the reading order, which directly impacts how screen readers interpret content. CommonLook empowers users to manage reading order efficiently by providing methods to open/close tags in the tags panel, such as clicking on the arrow left of the tag, double-clicking the tag, or using keyboard shortcuts.

Additionally, using the correct tag types ensures accurate information delivery to screen readers, enhancing the overall accessibility of the document.

## Headings and Tag Hierarchies

Headings play a pivotal role in organizing content and providing a structured reading experience. CommonLook emphasizes the importance of using a single h1 tag for the document title and maintaining the correct hierarchical order for headings. This hierarchical approach ensures seamless navigation for individuals using assistive technologies.

## Creating and Inserting New Tags

CommonLook simplifies the process of creating and inserting new tags, making it user-friendly and efficient. Users can click and drag elements from the physical view to create new tags and select the appropriate tag type from the insert tag menu. Keyboard shortcuts further enhance productivity, allowing users to perform actions swiftly.
