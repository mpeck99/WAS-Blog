Audio descriptions add experience for those who are blind by providing them descriptions of things that cannot be seen such as: 
- Scenery
- Facial expressions
- Any important content shown visually 

A narrator will speak when there are any gaps in the dialogue or sounds of the movie to provide enough commentary for those who are blind to understand the story. It works best when there is functionality for your users to turn off when not needed, or if there is a separate version of the video with the audio description
 
 ## When are audio descriptions needed?
 If your video does not have any additional video information such as photos are charts, and the information can easily be scripted in a way to include all important content that would be visually seen in an audible way then you do not need to include an audio description. 
 
 If you cannot script your video in a way to provide all this information then you should include an audio description. 

 It is also best to include a transcript for any of your deafblind users. 

 ### Prerecorded multimedia(video plus audio) must include audio descriptions
 These video files that contain essential information that can only be conveyed visually must come with an audio description track. 

 ### Prerecorded video-only content must include audio descriptions or a transcript
 Its best to provide both the audio description and a transcript because transcripts will allow all types of users access to the content.

 ### Audio descriptions may be provided for live multimedia(video plus audio) content 
 This is an art and science that requires trained audio-describers and a technical platform to provide this alternate audio. There is no requirement under WCAG 2.1, Section 508 or The 21st Century Video Communications and Accessibility Act (CVAA) to provide an audio description for live multimedia content but if you record the live event and then make it available for viewing later you may need to add this. 

 ### Audio descriptions may be provided for live video-only content
 This is very similar to the live multimedia content so see above.
