# CommonLook Training: Lists

## List structure
|-- L
    |-- LI
        |-- Lbl
            |-- Symbol
        |-- LBody
            |-- Text or List (L)

## Generating list from a selection
Highlight all items that are supposed to be a list but are not structurrally in the tag panel. 

When the elements are selected you can: 
- navigate to insert tag > generate tag from selection > List; or
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>

After you generate a list from a selection you will need to ensure that the list structure is correct and only contains either a symbol (in the label) or text/list in the LBody
