Well I have officially started down the journey of becoming a Web Accessibility Specialist. IAAP has a bunch of resources to help prepare for the exam as well as courses they recommend taking so figuring out where I want to start was a little tough. In the end I have decided to start going over the [WAS Content Outline](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/was-credential-content-outline) and the [ WAS 2.1 Body of Knowledge](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/WAS_Certification_FInal_2020_FINAL).

I am not going to lie looking at all the material together I am a little intimidated. Will I be able to go through all of this? Am I smart enough for this? Am I in over my head? There is so much to learn and understand in the field of accessibility. I am going to give it my all and dive deep into the materials and hope for the best.

### What I have accomplished

- Read through the content outline to narrow down the fields I think I should spend more time on
- Download the Book of Knowledge and begin going through it
- Started reading about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
- Enrolled in Deque's WAS Preparation course
